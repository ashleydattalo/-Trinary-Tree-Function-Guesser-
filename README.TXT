Title: “Trinary Tree Function Guesser”

Instruction: Clone the repository onto your computer. Then to run the Applet, click 'Run Applet' on the Display.java class.


Why did I create this project?:
In my Data Structures class I loved learning about Binary Trees, and what you could do with them. I wanted my tree to represent functions. For example, if the form is f(x) = a*x + b, then, the value at the parent node is x, and the value at the child node is f(x). My game takes this principal, and turns it into a game where you guess a and b, given the generated tree. 


Note: The game has a Java Applet interface, as well as a command line interface. The Java Applet draws out the tree, so it is easier to visualize.
